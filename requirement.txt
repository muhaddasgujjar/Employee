1. Functional Requirements
These define what the system must do.

Add Performance Evaluation

The system shall allow users to enter an employee’s name and evaluation notes.

The system shall validate that both fields are not empty before submission.

The system shall display a success message when the evaluation is submitted.

Clear Form After Submission

The system shall clear the input fields after successful submission.

Error Handling

The system shall display warning messages if input fields are empty.

Navigation

The system shall provide a "Back" button to return to the main menu or previous screen.

UI Launch

The system shall open the Performance Evaluation UI in a new window using tk.Toplevel().

✅ 2. Non-Functional Requirements
These define how well the system performs.

Usability

The interface shall be user-friendly with clear labels and input fields.

Buttons shall be clearly labeled and color-coded for intuitive use.

Performance

The UI shall respond to user actions (submit, back) within 1 second.

Maintainability

The logic and UI code shall be modular to support future enhancements (e.g., saving to database).

Reliability

The system shall handle missing input gracefully without crashing.

Portability

The application shall run on any system that supports Python and Tkinter.

✅ 3. User Requirements
These define what the user needs or expects.

As a user, I want to:

Enter employee performance evaluations quickly.

Be notified if I forget to fill any required fields.

Receive confirmation that my input was successfully submitted.

Easily navigate back to the main screen.

✅ 4. Business Requirements
These relate to organizational goals or constraints.

The system shall streamline employee performance evaluation entry in small or mid-size organizations.

The tool shall help HR or managers digitize basic evaluations before they’re integrated into a database or HRMS.

The system should be extendable to support storage in a database or file system.

The application shall be developed as a low-cost, internal HR tool without licensing constraints.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Project Title: Employee Performance Evaluation System (Tkinter GUI)

1. Introduction

1.1 PurposeThis document specifies the software requirements for the Employee Performance Evaluation System. The system allows users (typically HR personnel or managers) to enter and manage employee evaluation data through a graphical user interface.

1.2 ScopeThe software will be a desktop application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides functionalities to submit employee evaluations and basic validations, with potential extensibility for database integration.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

GUI: Graphical User Interface

SRS: Software Requirements Specification

HR: Human Resources

1.4 OverviewThis document outlines the functional, non-functional, user, and business requirements of the system. It also describes design constraints and system features.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product PerspectiveThe system is a standalone application intended for internal use by HR departments. It may be extended to connect to a backend database for storing evaluation records.

2.2 Product Functions

Input fields for employee name and performance notes

Submit button for saving evaluations

Basic validation for input completeness

Back button to return to the main menu

Feedback messages (success and error)

2.3 User CharacteristicsUsers are expected to have basic computer literacy. No technical background is required to operate the system.

2.4 Constraints

The application must run on a Python environment with Tkinter installed.

Initially, there will be no persistent storage (unless extended).

2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

Python and Tkinter must be pre-installed on the host machine.

Database integration is a possible future requirement.
